# Superhero-Hunter-JS
An application made to show information of different superheroes based on the data fetched using MARVEL API 

This is an application made using HTML, Bootstrap framework, Javascript and the MARVEL API.

The purpose of this website is to fetch information of different superheroes using API calls and then presenting relevant information on the webpage.
Different information like name, thumbnail image, number of series , number of stories is present here. Along with this, links to the comics and more details
corresponding to each superhero is also provided which takes the user to the MARVEL page for this information.

There are two pages in this project. One for the home content where the information of all the heroes will be present and the other page is for the favourites
section where the user can decide which heroes to add to the favourites page and which to remove. 
The favourites information is stored locally so that the information does not get lost when the page reloads. 
Favourites can also be handled form the search bar as well.

This project is made using vanilla javascript. no libraries or frameworks are used for this.
